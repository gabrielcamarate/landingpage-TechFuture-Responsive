## üìñ About the Project

The **TechFuture Landing Page** was created as a practical exercise to develop a modern and professional interface, focused on conversion and showcasing a technology company. The layout was built from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS with Flexbox and Media Queries to ensure responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactivity.

**Key Features:**
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** Perfectly adapts to desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Subtle animation effects when scrolling down the page, implemented with the `ScrollReveal.js` library.
*   **Interactive Mobile Menu:** A functional hamburger menu for smooth navigation on smaller devices.
